Senior Mobile Engineer Gt School | Crossover | Argentina

Crossover is the world’s #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We’re recruiting this role for our client, gt.school. Have you got what it takes?

gt.school is pioneering the delivery of 100% computer-based education to K-12 students through the use of generative AI!

We are looking for a senior mobile developer to help us build a learning app that’s as easy to use as TikTok and knows what the student knows and doesn’t know when it comes to serving learning content, as well as TikTok knows what its users like or don’t like when it comes to serving videos.

Join us in what is likely the next revolution in education – a school where kids learn on their own, at their own pace, using adaptive learning apps, without having to be in a physical classroom that’s going either too fast or too slow for them.

What You Will Be Doing
• Architect and implement features as per... detailed product specs and high-fidelity designs

What You Won’t Be Doing
• Fussing over UI/UX design details; these are handled by a dedicated design team.
• Endlessly debating functional requirements or feature priorities; these are well defined, in small increments

Senior Mobile Engineer Key Responsibilities
• Delivering clean, well-designed code in small functional increments.
• Making key implementation decisions, and describing your rationale.
• Contributing to continuous process improvement
• Detecting and correcting creeping technical debt

Basic Requirements
• Minimum 5 years of experience developing mobile applications
• Minimum 2 years in a leadership role, making technical design decisions for mobile applications
• Experience with the following cross-platform app development frameworks: React Native.

About Gt.school

gt.school is a stealth EdTech startup in Austin, Texas, the center of educational innovation in the US. Our unique approach leverages 50+ years of learning science, cutting-edge data analytics and high-performance life skills coaching. In doing so, we can help students learn 5x faster and unlock their full potential in both academics and in life. We are a remote-first company that hires globally via Crossover.

There is so much to cover for this exciting role, and space here is limited. Hit the Apply button if you found this interesting and want to learn more. We look forward to meeting you!

Working with Crossover

This is a full-time (40 hours per week), long-term position. The position is immediately available and requires entering into an independent contractor agreement with Crossover. The compensation level for this role is $50 USD/hour, which equates to $100,000 USD/year assuming 40 hours per week and 50 weeks per year. The payment period is weekly. Consult www.crossover.com/help-and-faqs for more details on this topic.

What to expect next:
• You will receive an email with a link to start your self-paced, online job application.
• Our hiring platform will guide you through a series of online “screening” assessments to check for basic job fit, job-related skills, and finally a few real-world job-specific assignments.

Important! If you do not receive an email from us:
• First, emails may take up to 15 minutes to send, refresh and check again.
• Second, check your spam and junk folders for an email from Crossover.com, mark as “Not Spam” since you will receive other emails as well.
• Third, we will send to whatever email account you indicated on the Apply form – by default, that is the email address you use as your LinkedIn username and it might be different than the one you have already checked.
• If all else fails, just reset your password by visiting https://www.crossover.com/auth/password-recovery if you already applied using LinkedIn EasyApply.

We are a fully remote workforce with headquarters in Tampa Bay, Florida and employees worldwide. Our services cover the spectrum for startups so we can help them plan, design, build, and support high-quality digital products.

Our founder, James, started OneSeven over five years ago after his experience hiring an offshore agency for his pre-seed Ed-Tech startup.

Since then, he built OneSeven and tailored our services to support startup founders needing high-quality software... development.

• Get involved earlier in the sales process by doing quick mockups and rapid prototyping for leads in the pipeline to prove that we deliver value.
• Help the marketing team with occasional graphic design projects or new website pages.
• Own the entire design lifecycle from documentation to delivery of high-fidelity designs.
• Complete user and competitive research as needed to help influence design concepts and iterate design work.
• Engage in usability testing and perform design validation research.
• Present your designs with confidence, no matter what stage, and collect actionable feedback for iterating.
• Leverage data to make well thought out and educated design decisions.
• Interact and communicate effectively with key client stakeholders.
• Follow agile methodologies and processes to complete projects.

WHO YOU ARE
• 2-5 years of experience working in user experience design/research, interactive design, user interface design, graphic design, branding or a related field.
• Values data-driven and research-backed design decisions.
• A proactive go-getter who identifies problems and seeks solutions.
• Can work both autonomously and collaboratively in a team environment.
• Experience working with fast-paced startups from Pre-Seed to Series A
• Experience working closely with strategists, project managers, and developers in an agile environment (sprint backlogs, daily standups, etc).
• Passionate and looking to make an impact through design.
• The startup world excites you and sparks your entrepreneurial spirit.
• Strong communication and presentation skills
• Previous agency experience is a plus!
• Demonstrated written and verbal fluency in English (required)

Project Description

Our client, a fast-growing remote-first software-as-a-service company that builds web & mobile software for the property inspection industry, is looking for a Sr. Full-Stack Developer (Ruby on Rails/JavaScript) to be part of a small but rapidly growing team with big ambitions.

OneSeven is a US-based product development studio building apps for industry-changing startups and enterprises. We love building digital products and helping companies succeed in their market. Working at OneSeven is a great opportunity to test your skills, build new skills, and be an early employee at a growing startup. We are a fully remote workforce with headquarters in Tampa Bay, Florida, and employees all around the world. Our services cover the spectrum for startups so we can help them plan, design, build, and support high-quality digital products.

Our founder, James, started OneSeven over five years ago after his experience hiring an offshore agency for his pre-seed Ed-Tech startup. The project was unsuccessful due to communication issues, conflicting time zones, and scope creep. Since then, he built OneSeven and tailored our services to support startup founders in need of high-quality software development.

The role: We are looking for a great Fullstack... developer who is proficient with React/Node.js/Typescript/AWS/PostgreSQL. Your primary focus will be on developing user interface components and implementing them following well-known React workflows (such as Flux or Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. You will coordinate with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem-solving, sophisticated design, and quality product is important.

About You:
• Fluent in English (B2-C2 level is required)
• 2-5 years of experience building B2B/B2C software.
• Excellent code practices
• Excellent communication skills
• Strong mentoring and code review skills
• Agile + Scrum Methodology experience
• Ability to quickly adapt, learn, and problem solve
• Team player, willing to jump outside of their role to help the greater team.
• Ability to research as you work.
• Clear written communication, and the ability to quickly identify and share important discoveries and problems in your work with others on the team.
• Opinions about backend approaches and architecture, and a readiness to share them without being dogmatic.
• The ability to be accountable for your own time in a fully remote environment.
• The desire to contribute to a growing, dynamic team and help shape process, practice and operations.
• Ability to understand business requirements and translate them into technical requirements
• We work in two-week sprints and monthly feature releases.
• The ability to follow common Agile practices (daily async standups, sprint groomings and retros). We’re always looking to improve on how we function as a team.

Role and Responsibilities:
• Building reusable components and front-end libraries for future use.
• Developing new user-facing features using React.js.
• Translating designs and wireframes into high-quality code.
• Optimizing components for maximum performance across a vast array of web-capable devices and browsers
• Familiarity with RESTful APIs
• Familiarity with newer specifications of EcmaScript
• 3+ years of experience with frontend libraries like React or React Native for mobile
• GIT + Github Experience
• Experience with Google Firebase is a must.
• Experience with typescript.
• Experience with PostgreSQL is preferred.
• Experience working with Docker is preferred.
• Experience with AWS is preferred.
• Experience with Node.js is preferred.
• Thorough understanding of React.js and its core principles.
• Knowledge of modern authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Token

Benefits/Compensation:
• Completely remote work as long as you can work between 9 am-5 pm EST
• Contract-based employment
• Starting at $2,000 - $4,000 USD - depending on qualifications
• Budget for education
• Christmas Bonus
• Unlimited PTO

FullStackRemote is a network of expert-level remote workers around the globe. We specialize in offering top-tier software engineering talent along with product, digital marketing, sales, and operations support. We work with startups and small to medium-sized businesses that create game-changing products to solve fun challenges.

We help connect you to your ideal remote job and to work alongside other smart people. We believe in transparency and we seek people with ambition who are team players, collaborative, and who care more about building stellar products that impact the world than just a job.

Project Description

Our client, a fast-growing remote-first software-as-a-service company that builds web & mobile software for the property inspection industry, is looking for a Sr. Full-Stack Developer (Ruby on Rails/JavaScript) to be part of a small but rapidly growing team with big ambitions.

The platform helps home inspectors work more efficiently, allows agents to... streamline the inspection process, and empowers homebuyers to make better decisions.
This is the kind of company where you can rapidly accelerate your career if you have what it takes! A team of energetic, positive, and motivated individuals with track records of building successful companies. Good communication is highly valued, staying grounded, and taking care of everyone holistically. The company doubled in size (or more!) each of the past 3 years and just on the ground floor of where it will go.

Work-life balance: Our client believes in balance. They encourage walks, breaks, and exercise to break up the day. They typically work a 40-45 hours work week, with the occasional push depending on the sprint. They realize it's a marathon and not a sprint, so they don't think working to the point of burnout is a good practice.
Communication: Via Slack and Zoom chats, encouraging real relationships to be built.

Role & Responsibilities

Are you looking for a small but fast-growing team where you can make a large impact? Are you a driven self-starter wanting to focus on building great products with modern technology?

Join this amazing team to grow your skillset and help push their tech into the future of SaaS.

Next Steps

Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:
• What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?
• List any published apps that you have.
• What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?
• What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals? (We’re serious, we want to know Share what you’re comfortable sharing, but we are a group of ambitious individuals building a community of people who want to achieve success in every aspect of our lives, and we encourage employees to figure out how they can use Expensify to realize their personal goals with the support of the company around them.)
• How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.

About Very

Very is a fully distributed IoT technology firm led by expert problem-solvers to create efficient, scalable solutions that move commercial, industrial, and consumer IoT projects from pilot to production in record time.

We’ve built a collaborative, tight-knit team that thrives, whether we’re hanging out in person at our annual retreat or coordinating work across time zones. The results show that we’re doing something right — as we’ve won numerous workplace awards over the years. Most recently in 2021 we were certified as a Great Place to Work, and in 2022 we were listed again in Parity.org’s list of Best Companies for Women to Advance.

We believe that everything we build — and the people we build it with — has the potential to change the world. Our client list includes numerous well-known brands determined to leverage the power of IoT to drive material outcomes — such as Vizio, Peloton, Clear, iHeart Radio and... Fellowes. Our goal, for each and every client we partner with, is to create high-value solutions through a collaborative and user-centered process.

About This Role

As a Generalist Lead Data Scientist at Very, you will work with our Software, Hardware, and Product Design teams to build full-service solutions for our clients. We focus on building end-to-end hardware and software solutions that meet our client's business needs, and reliable machine learning systems are often a part of our offering. An ideal candidate will display technical expertise in machine learning and data science, as well as strong communication skills, and the ability to present ideas and results to audiences ranging in technical depth. Candidates should also have experience translating business problems into analytical solutions, working in interdisciplinary teams, and building ML models for production systems.

What You’ll Be Working On

At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. However, it is critical to note that almost all of these projects are production systems. As such, the only consistent research component of this position will revolve around establishing a pattern of delivery that allows the team to implement full-scale applications leveraging machine learning in a fast, predictable manner.

You’ll spend 80-90% of your time working on products or platforms for one of our clients, and the other 10-20% of your time will be spent improving Very’s Data Science Practice. This will involve:

- Working with other data scientists to continuously improve our delivery process for data science applications.

- Working with our marketing team to generate high-quality content (blog posts, conference presentations)

- Working with our sales team to close deals and build meaningful, well-scoped proposals for potential clients.

As a lead data scientist, you will be expected to not only understand the following analytical approaches but also be able to guide others in their implementation:

- Predictive modeling and/or anomaly detection on multivariate time series data

- State classification and prediction for geospatial time series data

- Regression and classification using a variety of deep learning and ensemble tree-based methods

- Clustering/segmentation

- Dimensionality reduction or latent space representation

- Classical statistical analysis and signal processing

Our Current Tooling

Our data science contracts typically involve building a greenfield API or greenfield product from the ground up. In the context of the data science and machine learning pipelines, we typically leverage:

- Git, GitHub, CircleCI or GitHub Actions (CI/CD), pytest (TDD)

- The standard SciPy Stack (Numpy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)

- SQL/Postgres

- Docker

- Jupyter notebooks for prototyping

- Cloud architecture and resources for production systems. eg)

-- AWS: Lambda, ECR/ECS, RDS, API Gateway, Batch, Sagemaker

-- Azure: Functions, Container Registry/Instances, SQL Database [for PostgreSQL/MySQL], API Management, Machine Learning

-- 3rd party: TimescaleDB

- Serverless or Terraform for Infrastructure-as-Code

- MLflow

- PyTorch

On our full-service builds, we often reach for the following tools. Experience with them is not required, but any familiarity with these tools is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here:

- Python web development frameworks (Django, Flask)

- React & React Native

- Swift & Objective C

- Ruby on Rails

As an IoT technology company our data science pipelines include “Things”. This will require you to build pipelines and deploy analytical models to hardware on the edge in addition to the cloud. This requires a deep collaboration with the design, software and hardware teams in the following environments:

- Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves

- Embedded C and other lower level languages such as Rust

- CI/CD including hardware and end-to-end testing and verification

- Development Single-Board Computers such as RPi

At Very we have two types of lead positions; a specialist and generalist. Both positions go beyond the mastery of the core Data Science competencies to include a leadership position. The specialist lead focuses in great depth in one or more areas of Data Science and spreads that mastery across Very. The generalist lead takes a more multi-disciplinary approach and leads multi-disciplinary projects from a technical perspective.

Why us:

Twosense is a venture-backed startup that is fundamentally changing the nature of digital identity. Identity security is completely failing to meet our needs. The current paradigm creates a puzzle that only the authorized user can solve. Humans are constantly solving these puzzles (passwords, text messages, emails, secret questions, dongles, etc), which is a universally terrible experience, yet still, a single user error can drain your bank account, damage a company, or bankrupt your employer. Twosense is software that automates all the work the user has to do, so security is invisible and always on at every second. We use AI to enable any system to learn to recognize the user based on behavior, such as gait, typing behavior, mouse movement, usage patterns, and many more, creating the world’s first invisible, private biometric. Our mission is to fundamentally change the nature of secure... human-computer interaction so that the security does not have a user experience, and you can’t make a mistake. We’re creating a future where how bad it is today to forget a password, or to type in 6-digit codes from text messages, will be a fading memory.

This is a unique opportunity to join a driven engineering team just after liftoff. We’re an engineer-founded and led team of PhDs and outstanding Software Engineers out of Brooklyn, NYC. We value transparency, agency, continuous improvement, and engineering culture. We are fully remote, well funded, and we always do our absolute best to take care of our people. We’re currently deployed to a specific market of Healthcare and Contact Center customers that are unable to achieve compliance without a passive form of security.

What you will do:

This is a cross-functional role focused on developing data infrastructure and pipelines for our ML data flows - from training to inference. You’ll be working with Josh on infrastructure and DevOps. You’ll also be collaborating with Chris on data pipelines and flows, and Jack on ML process, model training, evaluation, and deployment pipelines. You’ll also be working with the rest of the team and our CTO John on overall strategy, platform, and architecture. You’ll be reviewing code from each of them, and they’ll be reviewing yours.

Who you are:

You’re comfortable in the dynamic environment of a startup, but also like working on a team that’s dedicated to finding the right way to build software, and continually improve. You are excited about, and experienced in building and maintaining data infrastructure and pipelines in production. You may not have worked directly with Machine Learning much, or at all, but you’re excited to step into a team with deep expertise in ML and learn on the way up. Most of all, you are looking to learn new things every day, and how much you learn is more important to you than the language or tools you use.
• You have strong Software Engineering fundamentals like SOLID principles, and you enjoy learning new and better ways to hone your craft.
• You have strong Python skills and enjoy working in various Python frameworks.
• You have experience working with varied data types, and building robust data pipelines from design and development to testing and deployment.
• You have experience with containerized deployments in cloud environments. Using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, EKS, etc…
• You enjoy working on a team where the code and software engineering process is communal property, and tickets are highly collaborative with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous processes.

What's in it for you:

We value our people and culture as a top priority. Benefits include:
• Salary of $5k - $7k per month
• Flexible work - work from home or use the Brooklyn office at your convenience.
• Project day - One day per month spent on whatever you think is important.
• Equity participation - everyone shares in our success
• Open vacation policy - take it when you need it
• Fitness stipend, commuter benefits

For employees in Argentina we have:

Identity security is completely failing to meet our needs. The current paradigm creates a puzzle that only the authorized user can solve. Humans are constantly solving these puzzles (passwords, text messages, emails, secret questions, dongles, etc), which is a universally terrible experience, yet still, a single user error can drain your bank account, damage a company, or bankrupt your employer. Twosense is software that automates all the work the user has to do, so security is invisible and always on at every second. We use AI to enable any system to learn to recognize the user based on behavior, such as gait, typing behavior, mouse movement, usage patterns, and many more, creating the world’s first invisible, private biometric. Our mission is to fundamentally change the nature of secure... human-computer interaction so that the security does not have a user experience, and you can’t make a mistake. We’re creating a future where how bad it is today to forget a password, or to type in 6-digit codes from text messages, will be a fading memory.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to join a driven engineering team just after liftoff. We’re an engineer-founded and led team of PhDs and outstanding Software Engineers out of Brooklyn, NYC. We value transparency, agency, continuous improvement, and engineering culture. We are fully remote, well funded, and we always do our absolute best to take care of our people. We’re currently deployed to a specific market of Healthcare and Contact Center customers that are unable to achieve compliance without a passive form of security.\n\nWhat you will do:\n\nThis is a cross-functional role focused on developing data infrastructure and pipelines for our ML data flows - from training to inference. You’ll be working with Josh on infrastructure and DevOps. You’ll also be collaborating with Chris on data pipelines and flows, and Jack on ML process, model training, evaluation, and deployment pipelines. You’ll also be working with the rest of the team and our CTO John on overall strategy, platform, and architecture. You’ll be reviewing code from each of them, and they’ll be reviewing yours.\n\nWho you are:\n\nYou’re comfortable in the dynamic environment of a startup, but also like working on a team that’s dedicated to finding the right way to build software, and continually improve. You are excited about, and experienced in building and maintaining data infrastructure and pipelines in production. You may not have worked directly with Machine Learning much, or at all, but you’re excited to step into a team with deep expertise in ML and learn on the way up. Most of all, you are looking to learn new things every day, and how much you learn is more important to you than the language or tools you use.\n• You have strong Software Engineering fundamentals like SOLID principles, and you enjoy learning new and better ways to hone your craft.\n• You have strong Python skills and enjoy working in various Python frameworks.\n• You have experience working with varied data types, and building robust data pipelines from design and development to testing and deployment.\n• You have experience with containerized deployments in cloud environments. Using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, EKS, etc…\n• You enjoy working on a team where the code and software engineering process is communal property, and tickets are highly collaborative with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous processes.\n\nWhat's in it for you:\n\nWe value our people and culture as a top priority. Benefits include:\n• Salary of $5k - $7k per month\n• Flexible work - work from home or use the Brooklyn office at your convenience.\n• Project day - One day per month spent on whatever you think is important.\n• Equity participation - everyone shares in our success\n• Open vacation policy - take it when you need it\n• Fitness stipend, commuter benefits\n\nFor employees in Argentina we have:\n• Business English language courses\n• Travel to team events and in-person all-hands\n• Technical books, VPN Access, high-end work computer, etc.\n\nWe are a young, hungry, and well-funded company and you’re getting in on the ground floor.

$50,750 $62,422 Annually

The Pulitzer Center, a non-profit organization that supports independent global journalism, is seeking an experienced and versatile data specialist for the position of Data Specialist. The successful candidate will join the Environmental Investigations Unit and work closely with our Data Editor and Research Editor.

The Environmental Investigations Unit provides support to grantees and fellows across Pulitzer initiatives, including the Rainforest Investigations (RIN), Ocean Reporting Network (ORN) and Artificial Intelligence Accountability Networks. The first two networks seek to harness investigative reporting and cross-border collaboration to tackle stories at the intersection of climate change, corruption, and governance behind the destruction of our rainforests and marine ecosystems. The AI Accountability Network supports and brings together journalists investigating the impact of... AI with an accountability lens, and journalists seeking to use machine learning to augment their reporting capacity on big data projects. Most reporting projects conducted by journalists in the three networks are data-driven and leverage technical knowledge (such as scraping, data analysis, satellite imagery, API or machine learning) to create real-world impact. You will have the unique opportunity to support, mentor and collaborate with some of the world’s leading investigative journalists, designing and executing their investigation methodologies.

The Data Specialist will work directly with our editors to support fellows and grantees. We are seeking an enterprising and team-oriented professional who will learn from and contribute ideas and skills to the journalists’ projects in different parts of the world (with a focus on, but not limited to, Latin America, the greater Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia) and will work efficiently and collaboratively with diverse media outlets.

We are looking for a creative collaborator to perform technical tasks for journalists, demonstrate tools and train journalists how to use them and to mentor when needed. The person successful in this role will be an agile problem solver willing to support the project from start to finish.

A successful candidate for this position will be a resourceful action-taker who enjoys tackling new problems by knowing where to find solutions and acquiring the necessary knowledge or skills related to the three topics that we work on (rainforest, ocean and artificial intelligence). You are constantly learning and searching out the latest tools and resources, or scoping out and building new ones. You will have opportunities to share your solutions by publishing reporting recipes (toolkits), methodologies or the datasets to contribute to the advancement of investigative journalism. As the networks expand and reporting projects diversify, you will have a voice in shaping your role and responsibilities.
Responsibilities:

Research and support for fellows
• Researching tools and solutions for technical issues.
• Providing one-on-one training to fellows, including meeting regularly to provide advice, help troubleshoot projects’ methodologies, suggest the best technical tools and data, and perform technical tasks like scraping online databases and performing statistical analysis when necessary.
• Building tutorials/documentation for fellows on investigation tools and skills.
• Developing methodologies and documentation that can contribute to advancing data and investigative journalism in environment and AI.

Project management
• Facilitating and coordinating collaboration among fellows of the three initiatives.
• Contributing data and documents to in-house data intelligence platform.
• Coordinating and supervising the work of consultants and staff hired to initiatives aforementioned.
Qualifications:
• Fluency in oral and written English.
• Familiarity with other languages (especially from the regions of Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia) strongly preferred
• Strong project management skills, experience prioritizing and managing multiple tasks without compromising quality.
• Creative problem-solving and strategic innovation
• 3 – 5 years of experience in journalism or related fields; you don’t have to be a journalist but experience working with journalists or in journalism is a plus, as the position requires:
• A deep knowledge of past journalistic data projects that inform your suggestions and problem solving.
• A good understanding of core journalistic values, including accuracy, independence, and fairness.
• The belief in the power of stories to make complex issues urgent and relevant, and inspire action.
• Strong technical skills, via academic or professional work, including:
• Data analysis with coding (e.g. Python, R)
• Data scraping
• API
• Building new datasets when they are unavailable
• Geospatial analysis (e.g. QGIS, GEE)
• Satellite imagery and mapping
• Designing experiments to learn how algorithms make decisions
• Statistical knowledge (e.g. when analyzing datasets and algorithms)
• Proven experience or familiarity working with data sources related to the environment and AI technologies, including:
• Freedom of Information (FOI) request
• Government procurement data
• Company listings and stock exchange
• Import/export and trade data
• Shipping data (e.g. IMO vessel registration, VMS, AIS)
• Ocean science data (e.g. sea level, temperature, ice melt, pollution, acidification)
• Forest and land use data (e.g. deforestation, indigenous communities, mining)
• College Degree preferred.
• Ability to produce data visualizations for storytelling preferred.

This position is fully remote. Global candidates encouraged to apply.

This offer from ""Canonical"" has been enriched by Jobgether and got a 79.75% flex score.

HPC is an important and technically challenging compute domain, with specialised tooling and a very high requirement for precision, efficiency and automation. This role covers engineering management of a software development team we have created to deliver an outstanding HPC experience - from bare metal to public cloud - as part of the broader Ubuntu platform. We are looking for a range of skills and experience, but the heart of our effort will be Python software development for automation of key software in the HPC sphere.

To succeed in this application you must be outstanding at maths and sciences, and have built high quality software, learned about open source ideally by working on it directly, and be looking for an engineering management role with a company that makes mission-critical products for the global... market. You should also be familiar with the open source environment, and want to build products in partnership with a community.

As an engineering manager, you must also have excellent judgement about people - their motivations, abilities, developmental needs and prospects for success.

Engineering at Canonical requires hands-on code contribution and review, as well as architectural leadership. You will need to demonstrate insight into performance and quality engineering practices and ensure your team embraces effective disciplines on both fronts. You will need to be comfortable holding contributors accountable for work ethic and results. You must also have an understanding of security practices and principles and the impact that engineering choices have on product security.

We expect teams to deliver well-documented products and work with design professionals to shape the product experience. You should relish the opportunity to shape and direct and develop an engineering team that is happy and brilliant, and produces a product that will be a pleasure to use and to evolve.

For this role you must have deep experience with Python. Experience in HPC environments is a strong advantage. Familiarity with HPC hardware and software is also a strong advantage - delivering great experiences with Infiniband, RDMA, CUDA, MPI, Slurm, Lustre, Singularity and related technologies will be central to this team's work. It will also be advantageous to have experience with Docker image design and operations, and public cloud image design and operations.
What we offer you

Your base pay will depend on various factors including your geographical location, level of experience, knowledge and skills. In addition to the benefits above, certain roles are also eligible for additional benefits and rewards including annual bonuses and sales incentives based on revenue or utilisation. Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.

In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. Please note that additional benefits may apply depending on the work location and, for more information on these, you can ask in the later stages of the recruitment process.

Description

We have an opportunity for an experienced QA Automation Engineer to join a Canadian client in the banking/financial services industry. They're rebuilding their customer portal from scratch (and other projects too!) and need someone who can help build an automation testing framework from scratch.

The successful candidate can be located anywhere in Latin America, but you'll need to be available for up to 6 hours of overlap with the PST time zone. You'll need to have good communication skills (B2 or higher) for this role. The successful candidate will be prepared to work in a small startup-like team but within a larger mature and established organization.

Our client is still in the early stages of building the dev team and defining the technology stack, but it’s starting to take shape: React and Node.js on AWS. We are seeking a skilled and motivated engineer who can... play a vital role in ensuring the quality and reliability of client’ applications by developing and executing automated test scripts.

Key responsibilities may include:
• Develop and execute automated test scripts using industry-standard frameworks and tools.
• Collaborate with the development team to understand project requirements and design effective test strategies.
• Identify, analyze, and report software defects to facilitate efficient bug resolution.
• Contribute to the creation and maintenance of test plans, test cases, and test data.
• Set up and configure testing environments and test automation frameworks.
• Perform various types of testing, including functional, integration, regression, and performance testing.
• Participate in Agile ceremonies, providing insights and feedback to improve product quality.
• Work closely with developers to ensure proper integration and test coverage for new features and enhancements.
• Continuously enhance and optimize test automation frameworks and processes.
• Stay up-to-date with industry trends and emerging technologies related to automation testing.

Requirements:
• Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent experience).
• Solid experience in automation testing, with a focus on web applications.
• Experience setting up new applications and configuring testing environments.
• Strong understanding of AWS services and experience testing applications deployed on AWS.
• Familiarity with Agile methodologies and experience working in Agile development environments.
• Experience with test automation frameworks such as Cypress, Selenium, or Puppeteer.
• Strong knowledge of software testing principles, techniques, and best practices.
• Proficient in writing clear, concise, and comprehensive test cases and test scripts.
• Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, with a keen attention to detail.

Of Note:You will be required to prove you own laptop, basic software tools, and cell phone.
Completed background checks will be required prior to the start date if you are selected as a winning candidate.

The job is remote, but highly collaborative. You’ll feel immersed and connected with our senior team and our customers.

Overview of you and the role:
• Have significant experience and expertise in Vue.js, TypeScript and Node.js and have used it to build dynamic, web-based, B2B applications

Your development skill set also includes Typescript on the front. You have proficiency in scss, and have an eye for seamless and engaging user experiences. If you have experience with php, MariaDb and node.js, that is a huge plus. If you are knowledgeable about other modern API tools and frameworks, like Firebase, Graphql, etc., that's a plus too, as we like it when people can expand our skillset and bring new ideas to the table.

You are highly self-motivated, take a high degree of pride and care in your work. You are a developer that is productive and thorough; you excel at writing high quality code fast. You are a high value contributor that goes beyond just writing the code; you can lead and come up with new and better ideas. You meet deadlines and thrive in a dynamic environment. You are eager to build and deploy amazing things.

You also see the bigger picture, from the user’s perspective, and design and build to make their experience easy, intuitive and engaging. You have an innate desire to always be learning and improving. You can really understand the user’s experience, workflows and value propositions, and then carry this understanding into building, advancing and deploying even more spectacular back- and front-ends.

• respond to customer needs
• accelerate revenue opportunities
• implement and own certain API integrations

We are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.

Our 60 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.

• You have empathy for developers and their development/learning process: we usually hear from developers at their lowest and need to be understanding.
• You have a demonstrated creative problem-solving approach and strong analytical skills.
• You’re able to overlap your core working hours with Central Time Zone.
• Bonus points if you’ve used RevenueCat before or have shipped your own app.
In the first month, you'll:
• Learn the common frustrations our customers have, and help them ship their apps

Within the first 6 months, you'll:
• Identify key problem areas for developers and make targeted improvements that help developers
• Improve and create internal tools and dashboards for support and other internal processes
• Make significant contributions to the support process that helps you and your teammates be more efficient
Within the first 12 months, you'll:
• Develop a super-hero like intuition for the root causes of tickets and become an expert troubleshooter
• Interview, hire and mentor additional support engineers
• Discover new and unexpected ways to delight developers with our support experience
What we offer:
• $107,000 USD Salary regardless of your location
• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator
• 10 year window to exercise vested equity options

This is a remote full time role and can be held from anywhere in the world. We are fully remote from day one. Our team is spread across UK, India and Australia.

About the role

We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer at Chronicle to join the founding team and shape a product that will impact millions of users.

Our user experience is one of the most crucial parts of delivering a game-changing tool. We are looking for a strong and motivated developer who has a passion for building delightful productivity tools and wants to build for the future of work.

We use NodeJs + Typescript for our main backend service and React (with NextJs) + Typescript for our frontend codebase. We use GraphQL as a bridge between our frontend-backend. PostgreSQL is our main relational database. We have an in-house state management library that maintains the client-side state and a custom solution for Real-Time Collaboration using Socket.io

What you’ll do... at Chronicle

In 30 days you will
• Be paired with a chronicle companion, who will help you take on board our stack and get you to know Chronicle better
• Be a part of our sprint planning & review, monthly retrospectives, and start taking ownership of some tickets as you navigate through Chronicle’s codebase and understand the overall architecture
• Begin contributing towards product feedback by creating decks using chronicle

In 60 days you will
• Take full ownership of a feature from start to end. Plan the time and efforts for the tasks and subtasks. Collaborate with the design team and flag any potential issues with the feature. Run any necessary research spikes before we start building the feature.
• Chime in on new ways that you think can improve our flow and process. Pitch in with new tools or programming libraries/frameworks that can enhance our current build

In 90 days and beyond you will
• Own a complete module/subproject and ship multiple features in it. Set up a test framework for the module and handle code reviews for software patches that have an impact on it
• Participate in product brainstorming sessions and help design the longer product roadmap
• Discuss personal goals for learning and development and come up with a plan along with the team to accomplish them
• Be a part of refining and conducting the hiring process and help in growing the team
• Take mentorship responsibilities – help fellow team members to reach their goals
• Contribute to the overall engineering culture- in terms of how we build, communicate and test the product
• Grow with us — whether as a product leader, an engineering manager, or an individual contributor, we’ll invest in you

You will be a good fit if you
• Have 6+ years of extensive experience in full stack development, preferably seen a product scale and been a part of the 0-1 journey
• Have strong knowledge of SQL (preferably PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases
• Can design API services using either GraphQL or REST
• Can write kickass code in NodeJS and ReactJS
• Have experience in building microservices and designing event-based architecture
• Passionate about building frontend libraries for Web 2.0
• Are comfortable picking up new stacks and choosing the right tool to get the job done

We’d love it if you
• Have experience in building creation tools
• Made any open source contributions to frontend tools
• Have any kind of DevOps experience; preferably AWS
• Have experience building Real Time Collaboration (RTC) in a digital product
• Have strong opinions but are not ideologically tied to specific technologies; naturally curious and willing to take a step to learn something you don’t have experience in
• We’re looking for people who are excited about what we’re doing — if you believe that presentations are up for a radical disruption and are motivated to build a meaningful, delightful solution – this is the role for you

Why join us

We are solving a very interesting problem that will impact millions of users changing the way people craft and tell powerful stories every day. We are passionate to help anyone deliver presentations that are not just bearable, but enjoyable.
• We are a diverse and fast-paced and energetic startup team. We offer an opportunity to build the next big productivity tool with some of the smartest people in the space.
• We are learners at heart and we provide you free books of your choice every quarter, have regular lunch, and learn with the best leaders in tech
• Competitive salaries with ESOPs, performance-based bonuses, and raises
• We are remote from day one and support you to work from wherever you want by covering your home office expenses, hooking you up with the latest technology (think M2 chip Macs)
• We offer complete remote work, flex hours, and lots of wind-down opportunities, our be-well program offers $1000 per year that you can spend on whatever keeps you well","[{'items': ['Senior software engineer (full-stack) | Remote\n\nThis is a remote full time role and can be held from anywhere in the world.

From Our Client

We are re-imagining the trillion-dollar U.S. B2B card payments infrastructure, with a focus on the country’s 500,000 commercial fleets, 40 million commercial vehicles, and many million commercial drivers. The incumbent technologies that cater to these customers are decades old, and drivers, fleets, and the merchants that serve them all increasingly demand modern digital experiences and affordable and transparent financial services products. Our mission is to deliver them at a transformational scale, and to improve working lives in one of the... country’s biggest industry sectors. The company is backed by top fintech and mobility venture funds.

We are competing and winning with software, and we are building a world-class engineering team. We are looking for front-end, full-stack, backend, and platform engineers. This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground level early on, contribute and learn in myriad ways, make key decisions, expand your impact as the business grows, have fun, and learn a ton in the process. If you're practical and business-minded, smart and creative, and excited about the rewards and the energy of an early-stage venture-backed startup, we'd love to hear from you.

We believe in re-using existing tools as much as possible so that we can focus on building products for our clients. At the same time, we do not hesitate to roll up our sleeves and build our own if needed. Since we benefit from Open Source Software so much, we try to contribute back, e.g. https://github.com/loyada/dollarx and https://github.com/loyada/typedpy

In order to maximize the velocity of our product engineering, we are hiring in NYC and the tri-state area only. Our office is located in the heart of Manhattan’s NoHo neighborhood, benefiting from its vibrant creative energy.

About You

We are currently a team of 15 people — you will be #16 🙂

You enjoy writing beautiful code. You care not just about whether the code works, but you think deeply about how well it performs, and how it will be understood by future developers.

You like shipping things. You realize that building excellent products is a marathon, not a sprint, and regularly make improvements in iterations.

You are an excellent communicator. You realize that working remotely requires thoughtful communication and you do so through great written communication.

You self-manage and are open to feedback. You enjoy taking a goal and figuring out... how to ship it without heavy direction and regular check-ins.

You are product and customer-centric. Whether it is a bug fix, perf improvement, or a new feature, you realize that every line of code is an opportunity to make a user’s experience better.
Our Engineering Team

We are currently a team of 7 engineers. Our roles are divided based on the projects we work on.

We work in 4-week long development cycles in which we focus on adding new features, fixing bugs, or making improvements. After each cycle, we have a 2-week cool-off which we use to work on anything we would like to as well as plan for the next cycle.

Some things that you might work on include:
• Data : Scale our real-time data discovery engine to process 5x-10x more volume
• DevOps : Speed up our CI pipeline for faster builds
• Integrations : Add features to and revamp our Salesforce integration
• Monitoring : Modernize our logging and metrics infrastructure
• Reporting : Add functionality to allow customers to run advanced custom usage reports

• Initial screening (60 min) : Complete an asynchronous questionnaire and a relevant coding challenge
• CTO Interview (30 min) : A call with our CTO to delve into your experiences and discuss the projects we’re working on
• Live coding session (3 hours) : Collaborate on a problem with our team in real-time
• Founder’s interview (30 min) : A final conversation with our founders to understand your personal goals and share our company vision
• Job offer : If we find you're a great fit, we'll make you an offer at this stage

Web Developer required by iKrut, a fast growing Saas recruitment application - www.ikrut.com.

Who are we?

iKrut provides a fantastic, web based recruitment application to help power the hiring plans of fast growing small and mediums sized companies across the world. With hundreds of very demanding clients we have to continuously develop the software to ensure it meets the needs of the continuously changing market.

This means we have a regular need for great front and back end developers to join us on short term assignments.

What are we offering and what will you bring to iKrut?

We are looking to recruit an experienced .net developer. It is not essential that you have experience with a Saas application but experience in developing a web based, business to business product is key.
We are happy to consider applicants with a range of different skills but as a minimum you would need 3 years + of software development... experience including .net, Javascript, MS SQL and Angular or Bootstrap would be very advantageous.

Initially we are recruiting for a 3 month contract if you work full time but we can offer potentially less hours (minimum of 60 hours a month) which would be a 3 month contract, if you don't wish to work full time. The role would be home based (our technology team is based in Barcelona). It is very likely that the successfull candidate, assuming you do a great job for us, will be offered a contract extension until early 2021 as we have multiple new products we need to make live in the next 6 months.

You don't need to speak English (our tech team are all Spanish speaking), but a little bit would help.

The best devepers we have hired have 3 key qualities:

1. The can produce great code
2. They can translate the requests from clients (for new features) into a simple user experience (most developers are terrible at UI) - we need you to understand that the job of our Developers is not just coding. The tools you build must be intuitively simple. So simple that the client never needs any training on how to use it.
3. They are not afraid to challenge the assumptions on the best way to do something..............'Why don't we do this completely differently.....'

It is very rare to find a Developer who is skilled in all 3 and that is why we initially recruit for a short period and then if you are a superstar developer who find all 3 very easy............well then we'll offer you an extended contract and possibly a permanent position.

Please do apply, and ensure you give examples of websites you have worked on and what your role was.

The salary offered is $14 - $18 per hour.

2 - 3 meses contracto para un Web Desarrollador.

Desarrollador web requerido por iKrut, una aplicación de reclutamiento de Saas de rápido crecimiento: www.ikrut.com.

¿Quienes somos?

iKrut proporciona una fantástica aplicación de reclutamiento basada en la web para ayudar a impulsar los planes de contratación de las pequeñas y medianas empresas de rápido crecimiento en todo el mundo. Con cientos de clientes muy exigentes, tenemos que desarrollar continuamente el software para garantizar que satisfaga las necesidades del mercado en constante cambio.

Esto significa que tenemos una necesidad regular de grandes desarrolladores front-end y back-end para unirse a nosotros en tareas a corto plazo.

¿Qué ofrecemos y qué traerá a iKrut?

Estamos buscando reclutar un desarrollador .net experimentado. No es esencial que tenga experiencia con una aplicación Saas, pero la experiencia en el desarrollo de un producto 'business to business' es clave.
Nos complace considerar a los solicitantes con una gama de habilidades diferentes, pero como mínimo necesitaría más de 3 años de experiencia en desarrollo de software, incluidos .net, Javascript, MS SQL y Angular o Bootstrap, sería muy ventajoso.

Inicialmente estamos reclutando para un contrato de 2 meses si trabaja a tiempo completo, pero podemos ofrecerle potencialmente menos horas (mínimo de 60 horas al mes), lo que sería un contrato de 3 meses, si no desea trabajar a tiempo completo. El papel estaría en el hogar (nuestro equipo de tecnología tiene su sede en Barcelona). Es muy probable que al candidato exitoso, suponiendo que haga un gran trabajo para nosotros, se le ofrezca una extensión de contrato hasta principios de 2021, ya que tenemos varios productos nuevos que necesitamos para poner en marcha en los próximos 6 meses.

No necesita hablar inglés (nuestro equipo técnico habla español), pero un poco ayudaría.

Los mejores desarrolladores que hemos contratado tienen 3 cualidades clave:

1. El puede producir gran código
2. Pueden traducir las solicitudes de los clientes (para nuevas funciones) en una experiencia de usuario simple (la mayoría de los desarrolladores son terribles en la interfaz de usuario). Necesitamos que comprenda que el trabajo de nuestros Desarrolladores no es solo la codificación. Las herramientas que cree deben ser intuitivamente simples. Tan simple que el cliente nunca necesita capacitación sobre cómo usarlo.
3. No tienen miedo de desafiar las suposiciones sobre la mejor manera de hacer algo .............. '¿Por qué no hacemos esto completamente diferente .....'

Es muy raro encontrar un desarrollador que sea experto en los 3 y es por eso que inicialmente reclutamos por un período corto y luego, si usted es un desarrollador superestrella que encuentra los 3 muy fáciles ........... . Bueno, entonces le ofreceremos un contrato extendido y posiblemente un puesto permanente.

Solicite, y asegúrese de dar ejemplos de sitios web en los que ha trabajado y cuál fue su función.

UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.

Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.

And we never give up.

For every child, respect

South-South Cooperation, as underlined in the Framework of Operational Guidelines on United Nations support to South-South and Triangular Cooperation (SSTC), is defined as a
“process whereby two or more developing countries pursue their individual and/or shared national capacity development objectives through exchanges of knowledge, skills, resources and technical know-how and through regional and interregional collective actions, including partnerships involving Governments, regional organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector, for their individual and/or mutual benefit within and across... regions”.

During the Second High-Level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation (BAPA+40), SSTC was highlighted as a key strategy to eradicate poverty and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The importance of investment in the planning, monitoring, measuring and evaluation was also stressed as a key strategy to enhance SSTC.

In the context of the Brazilian Government, South-South Cooperation is understood as related to bilateral cooperation between two governments while those SSC arrangements that consist of different actors – developing countries, developed countries and/or International Organizations – are referred to as Trilateral South-South Cooperation (TSSC). As per the definition of the Brazilian Government, TSSC is based on the shared management among the different actors involved and the identified comparative advantages, and it may be implemented through different institutional arrangements such as: South-South-South; South-South-International Organization; “Trilateral +1”; and new formats of horizontal cooperation as well.

In 2011, the Government of Brazil and UNICEF joined forces to promote TSSC for children, based on Brazilian expertise and technical knowhow in the area of child rights. Formalized through the signing of a global Memorandum of Understanding between the two parties, the Brazil-UNICEF TSSC Programme has over the years engaged in cooperation with numerous partner countries from across the globe in all areas of the UNICEF mandate, while continuously seeking to improve the overall programme implementation, especially with regards to management, monitoring and evaluation, so as to ensure an ever more structured Programme with coherent strategies for the future and with concrete and measurable results and indicators.

As part of these efforts, the Programme has been investing in improved programming tools and guidelines, which include the recent development of a conceptual Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) framework (in 2019) and a subsequent Prototype MEL system (in 2021) for the Programme.

Such developments respond to the recommendations coming out of the external evaluation that was conducted in 2019, looking at 7 years of implementation with 16 countries. As part of the recommendations the evaluation called for the development of a functional MEL system for the Programme, to ensure progress are better monitored with well documented results, which in turn enable future evaluations and a continuous learning process.

How can you make a difference?

Drawing on the above introductory background, the purpose of this consultancy is to design and develop a functioning Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) system for the TSSC Programme. This work will draw on the previously developed Prototype MEL System (as mentioned above) as well as corresponding programming tools (also developed in 2021 in conjuncture with the Prototype System), all of which will be shared with the consultant at the beginning of the contract.

The MEL system will be developed as an internal system and will thus not be accessible to the general public.

The consultant can work remotely under the direct supervision of the UNICEF Information and Communications Technology Officer (Product Owner) and in close collaboration with the UNICEF South-South Cooperation Officer. In addition, the consultant will also work in close collaboration with the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC).

The overall expected results are as follow:
• Expected result #1

Support the software maintenance activities of the MEL platform and related technologies and provide small incremental updates.

Activities:

a) Improve the user experience of these platforms.

b) Monitor monthly the analyses with usage statistics of the MEL platform and send a report to the M&E team.

c) Monitor he performance of servers and the availability of the service, taking the necessary steps to restore normal operation in case of failure.

d) Fix bugs on a weekly basis.

e) Implement small improvements in the platform’s functionalities, keeping it updated with possible changes in business requirements. Software releases related to this item must be made on a bimonthly basis.
• Expected result #2

Support the technical planning and implementation of new modules related to MEL system, prioritized by the Monitoring and Evaluation area, to increase the availability of innovative solutions for UNICEF in Brazil.

Activities:

a) Support the development / establishment of a technological evolution roadmap, including planning the implementation of new complete modules to be integrated into the current platform or the development of completely new platforms.

b) Help maintain the backlog of pending issues and development progress on the ZenHub platform, keeping the information accurate and updated.

c) Technically and operationally support the preparation of technical materials / documentation – in accordance with organizational processes and management systems – to support the area of M&E in program planning, results-based planning (RBM) and monitoring and evaluation of results, including inputs for annual reporting and analysis.

d) Code the new modules and features. Incremental software releases related to this item should be done monthly and each major release every four months.

Deliverables:

Support the software development and maintenance activities of the MEL platform and related technologies and provide incremental updates.
• Support the technical planning and implementation of new modules related to MEL platform prioritized by the M&E (Monitoring and Evaluation) area, to increase the availability of innovative solutions for UNICEF in Brazil.
• Identification and bug fix for MEL platform prioritized by the M&E area.

Performance Indicators:

For this innovation project we will use the SCRUM framework as project execution methodology. In SCRUM, development cycles occur every two weeks, based on demands prioritized by key stakeholders and the product owner at the beginning of each sprint (defined during the Sprint planning meetings).

The above results will be measured through functional software releases committed to UNICEF’s private repository on GitHub and through periodic meetings with UNICEF M&E representatives, where the results will be presented and subject to formal approval. Therefore, twice a month we must wait for the delivery of a new set of features and once a month we must generate a new software version that will go live.

Ready to make a massive impact? At Paleovalley, the team is on the hunt for a driven Data Analyst to help them revolutionize their marketing strategies by making data-backed decisions. This isn't just another data job. You'll be the Sherlock Holmes of data, translating complex information into actionable insights that directly influence the business' growth and success.

Here's why you should be excited about this role:

You'll collaborate with an incredible team, including the CEO, CFO, Director of Marketing, Director of Retention, Conversion Rate Optimization Expert, and the Director of Paid Media. Your work will be front and center in the strategic decision-making, and you'll report to the Director of Marketing.

You'll have the opportunity to unleash your creativity, contributing to the growth strategies daily with your innovative ideas.

Your Key Responsibilities:

Be the resident expert in Mixpanel, mastering the platform and its capabilities.

Transform data into insights that drive marketing optimization across each department.

Generate targeted reports for each department based on their data needs.

More specifically, in this role, you will:
• Analyze and interpret data related to marketing campaigns, website traffic, customer behavior, and sales trends.
• Ensure the accuracy and integrity of data by creating and maintaining data quality control processes.
• Work closely with the marketing team to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide ongoing analysis and insights to inform marketing strategy and decision-making.
• Collaborate with go-to-market leadership to identify their teams' data and reporting needs.
• Develop and maintain dashboards and reports to track KPIs and key metrics.
• Identify areas of opportunity and improvement based on data insights.
• Partner with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities to improve data collection and analysis processes.
• Design and implement data-driven solutions that optimize Paleovalley's e-commerce platform and enhance customer experience.
• Stay up-to-date on industry trends and best practices in data analysis.

• Work closely with the product development team to ensure that new products meet customer needs and preferences.

First Weeks Snapshot:

Jump right in and familiarize yourself with Paleovalley's data structure, events in Mixpanel, and how to generate new reports. Understand the unique data needs of its departments and how they could benefit from your analysis.

Paleovalley is looking for an analytical powerhouse, someone who relishes diving into complex data sets, translating the numbers into actionable insights, and driving results. Collaboration, adaptability, and self-motivation are at the heart of who you are.

• A proven track record of working with big data; building and optimizing 'big data' data pipelines, architectures, and data sets.
• Ideally, at least 1 year of experience with Mixpanel.
• Bonus points for experience in e-commerce companies.

While the above are must-haves, we'd be especially excited if you also have:
• Extended Mixpanel experience (1+ years) and a history of working within e-commerce companies.

Remember, Paleovalley's after someone with a strong analytical mindset, self-motivated drive, adaptability to new situations, and a collaborative approach to achieving results.

Quorum Is Working to Advance Pay Equity: What Does That Mean For You?

In an effort to continue to build a diverse and inclusive work environment that advances pay equity, Quorum has implemented a “No Negotiation” policy for base salary for new hires for roles that are currently staffed by three or more team members. This means that candidates for the Full Stack Software Engineering role cannot negotiate Quorum’s base salary offer.

Here’s our promise to you:
• We will not ask you what you are currently earning.
• We will consider years of relevant experience, relevant professional certifications/education, and performance expectations in setting what we believe is a competitive, fair base salary offer.
• We will be transparent about our compensation structure (see above) so that all candidates have equal access to compensation information and can make an informed decision about whether or not Quorum is the right workplace for them.

If you are interested in learning more about how negotiation impacts pay equity and/or why other start-ups have decided to implement a “No Negotiation” policy of some type, here are a few resources: Project Include, AAUW, Ministry for Women, Magoosh.

Note: Quorum does not endorse or verify any of the information provided in the resources on the impact of negotiation on pay equity. We provide these resources simply to increase awareness of a topic we believe is important for both employers and candidates to consider.

We comply with all requirements for US government federal contractors issued by the OFCCP, IFR, and the terms of our government contracts.

Quorum focuses on Analytics, CRM, Governments, Politics, and Data Visualization. Their company has offices in Washington DC and Washington. They have a mid-size team that's between 51-200 employees.

Do you have experience with binary code analysis? Using tools like IDA is your second nature? Do you enjoy analyzing malware or finding security vulnerabilities?

Then analyzing a large application like Office will give you a whole new set of challenges!

You need to understand data structures and algorithms involving dozens of functions all from nothing but binary. Do you belong to the few people in the world who have these skills?

Then we are looking for you.

Here is what we offer in a nutshell :
• A wide array of extremely challenging tasks
• An international team of brilliant minds
• A working environment that makes this team stay and grow
• Enough time to make sure that every detail of your solution is perfect
• A flat organization and plenty of room for your ideas
• No scheduled meetings
• Family-friendly working hours, no deadlines, no overtime
• Support for relocation
• A competitive salary from the start and a raise... to EUR 130,000 annually after only one year

About our reverse engineering

think-cell distinguishes itself from other Microsoft Office add-ins by having an intuitive user interface, smart algorithms that automate many tasks and, not least, a deep integration into its Office host application.

To achieve this deep integration, we use the public APIs offered by Office and Windows whenever we can, but unfortunately, they do not let us do everything we want to do.

So we add our own customization hooks into the Office and Windows binaries. When think-cell loads, it finds the code locations and installs its hooks.

Instead of using fixed addresses, we find code locations using machine code patterns to be robust against minor changes. If an update to Office or Windows still breaks some of the patterns, think-cell will automatically download and install any available version with updated patterns.

Finding ways to achieve a desired customization is a truly zen-like activity. It requires deep analytical skills, the ability to juggle vast amounts of information in the head and quickly separate promising from less promising approaches.

Interested?

Then we are looking for you Here is what we offer in a nutshell • A wide array of extremely challenging tasks • An international team of brilliant minds • A working environment that makes this team stay and grow • Enough time to make sure that every detail of your solution is perfect • A flat organization and plenty of room for your ideas • No scheduled meetings • Family-friendly working hours no deadlines no overtime • Support for relocation • A competitive salary from the start and a raise to EUR 130000 annually after only one year About our reverse engineering think-cell distinguishes itself from other Microsoft Office add-ins by having an intuitive user interface smart algorithms that automate many tasks and not least a deep integration into its Office host application To achieve this deep integration we use the public APIs offered by Office and Windows whenever we can but unfortunately they do not let us do everything we want to do So we add our own customization hooks into the Office and Windows binaries When think-cell loads it finds the code locations and installs its hooks Instead of using fixed addresses we find code locations using machine code patterns to be robust against minor changes If an update to Office or Windows still breaks some of the patterns think-cell will automatically download and install any available version with updated patterns Finding ways to achieve a desired customization is a truly zen-like activity It requires deep analytical skills the ability to juggle vast amounts of information in the head and quickly separate promising from less promising approaches Interested?

However, much of the teams tasks are also not strictly web-related and may challenge you in other ways (e.g. data analytics, network communication, database optimization, etc.). You will have a lot of independence and agency while working, but will communicate with other colleagues daily and often work with them directly to solve coding issues.

This role requires the ability to work on a feature from start to finish, communicate about it, and ask the right questions along the way. Being comfortable with Java and confidently writing code to be deployed to production servers are key functions of this role as well. In addition, the ideal candidate will need to be able to tinker with Javascript code and wont be afraid to SSH into a server and change configuration files.

This role lies within our Engineering department and reports to the Engineering Manager.

But not just any startup; a start-up that is already profitable, is entirely bootstrapped (no VCs to keep happy), and with huge potential for growth.

Testpad is a SaaS tool for managing test plans. It’s for dev and test teams who are in a mess with spreadsheets, have hunted for a better solution, and before Testpad, gave up as everything else on the market is heavyweight traditional “test case management”. Testpad’s customers love how straightforward it is and regularly provide feedback saying what a joy it is to use.

Testpad has been built and run by Stefan Butlin, who has been working solo on Testpad since November 2010 and is now building a small team of awesome people to accelerate the growth of the company’s unique product.

Testpad is currently seeking a talented Python Developer to join their dynamic team and play a pivotal role in shaping their product. As a Python Developer, you will have significant... influence on the development process, actively contributing to decision-making, and collaborating closely with the Founder (a full-stack developer) and the Senior Software Engineer (a front-end specialist). Your primary focus will be on back-end projects, taking ownership of the design and implementation of new features.

Responsibilities include:

🚀 Taking ownership of the design and implementation of new features, especially with back-end systems.

🔌 Building new integrations to third-party platforms like GitHub, Jira, Slack, Teams, Notion, and more.

🌐 Improving and extending the Testpad API.

☁️ Automating and expanding the use of AWS services.

🐳 Upgrading the company’s use of Docker and Testpad's container management.

📂 Maintaining the MongoDB database or migrating to a hosted solution (you will help decide!).

After some initial onboarding, you will dive straight into projects such as adding 2FA/SSO, creating integrations with platforms like Github and Jira, assessing the company’s AWS architecture, and exploring opportunities to exploit AI/LLM capabilities. Testpad fosters continuous development and offers growth opportunities, such as code mentoring with external experts, and attending conferences or specialized training courses to support your growth.

This is a full-time position with flexible working hours. The company expects a commitment of 35 hours per week. Reasonable communication of availability is required, and a significant overlap with UK business hours is required for effective collaboration.

To thrive in this role, you need:

🎓 A degree in a numerate subject, preferably engineering (because they tend to be the most pragmatic problem solvers ;) but the likes of maths, science or computer science would also be appropriate)

🐍 2+ years of Python experience in a commercial context, preferably across multiple settings or companies. Bonus points if you have side projects (e.g. on GitHub) that you can show us.

☁️ 1+ years of hands-on experience with AWS, working with non-trivial collections of AWS services, not just pushing a couple of lambda functions to the web, but having a solid understanding of key services such as EC2, EBS, S3, ELB, VPC, Security Groups, and IAM.

🏗️ Demonstrated experience with design and architecture responsibilities, particularly at the subsystem components level. Testpad is looking for someone who can contribute ideas and not just implement designs handed down from more senior team members.

🐧 Proficiency in Unix/Linux environments, with at least 2 years of experience. You should be comfortable working with shells, writing scripts, ensuring security, handling patching, performing sysadmin tasks, and navigating filesystems.

In addition, it is essential that you have excellent English language skills. But everyone says that. By excellent, we mean that you can follow, contribute to, and even steer rapid conversations about complex technical topics; that you can debate and convey nuanced details, and clarify intricate ideas with ease.

Brownie points for:
• Further AWS Knowledge: Experience with ECS, Fargate, CodePipeline, CloudFront, CloudFormation, Lambda, SQS, SNS, and DocumentDB.
• Familiarity with MongoDB
• Proficiency and/or design knowledge of multiple database technologies (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).
• Familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
• Networking Expertise: Knowledge of TCP/IP, DNS, load-balancing, and firewalls.
• Familiarity with working on Macs.
• Experience packaging components in Docker containers.

The ideal candidate is someone with:
• Proven success with making critical design decisions in a commercial context
• Ability to generate very robust code, stemming from an attitude that leaves no error condition unhandled and investigating every uncertainty
• Not just excellent problem-solving skills, but the ability and perspective to analyse exactly what it is that needs to be solved in the first place
• An insatiable desire to know how things actually work; a black-box 3rd-party library “that just works” is deeply unsettling to you
• A spirit of generous collaboration with the team, contributing expertise wherever possible
• A desire for continuous learning, both professionally and personally

What’s in it for you?
• $4000 to $5000 per month*
• Full-time & fully remote
• Flexible working hours
• Five weeks of paid holidays per year
• Opportunity for training through mentors, training courses, and conferences
• Huge scope for professional development as Testpad grows
• Salary increase opportunities based on performance, contribution, and the growth of Testpad
• Opportunity to have a significant impact on product development
• Please note that this is a gross salary and that you are responsible for any tax-related procedures in your country of residence. We kindly ask you to apply only if you are happy to work remotely as an independent contractor.

This position will be closed as soon as we find the perfect match . So, make sure to read the description carefully and take your time to submit a high-quality application that stands out.

JobRack has been contracted by Testpad to support them in their hiring process on their behalf.

As part of this, the JobRack team has gained a full understanding of the needs of Testpad and will review, filter, screen and test candidates in line with this. Candidates that best meet the needs of Testpad will be submitted as part of a final shortlist. Feedback will be provided throughout the process.

Please expect the hiring process to include:

1 - Filling in the application form once you click “Apply”

2 - Upload your CV

3 - Short preliminary coding challenge

4 - Short interview with Testpad

5 - Short Technical Project: Post-first interview, you will be given a small web-app development project that aligns with the work at Testpad. This is a practical exercise designed to evaluate your coding skills and approach to real-world problems

6 - Attending video interviews with the hiring company where you will have the opportunity to talk more about your previous experience and the new role

Please note that this is a full-time position as part of the team, requiring 100% commitment, this is not a side job/freelance/part-time and therefore you should be intending this to be your primary and only full-time job/commitment.

If you are found to be attempting to work multiple full-time roles without the knowledge of your employer, your employment is likely to be terminated and you will be banned from applying to other jobs from our site.
